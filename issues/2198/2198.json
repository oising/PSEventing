    "Description": "use p/invoke to put a symbol on top right of console window perhaps, to show events waiting? this way you could hook a \"terminating\" event on a synchronous .net object, and run it in a new-job script (a la jim truher's). You would get a single event when the job completed, which would be indicated by the, err, indicator :)",
