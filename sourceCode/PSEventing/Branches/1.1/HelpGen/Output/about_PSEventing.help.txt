TOPIC
    PowerShell Eventing Library (version 0.5)

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the Windows PowerShell Eventing (PSEventing) snapin and 
    how to use the contained cmdlets and scripts that ship with PSEventing.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell Eventing is a PowerShell Snapin that opens a new door for 
    scripters into the powerful world of .NET events. Previously thought shut
    tight given the nature of the command-line driven prompt, this library 
    provides the tools to automatically capture events in real-time, but lets
    you deal with them in your time. 
    

CMDLETS
    The current PSEventing cmdlets are listed below:

    Get-Event
        TODO 
        
    New-Event
        TODO 
        
    Get-EventBinding
        TODO 
        
    Connect-EventListener
        TODO 
        
    Disconnect-EventListener
        TODO 
        
    Start-KeyHandler
        TODO 
        
    Stop-KeyHandler
        TODO 
        
INCLUDED EXAMPLE SCRIPTS
    FileSystemWatcher.ps1        
        An example script showing how to watch and respond to events 
        generated from the filesystem such as: changes, renames, updates,
        deletes, etc. 
        
        PS> .\examples\filesystemwatcher.ps1
    
    WMI.ps1
        An example script showing how to deal with WMI events using the 
        standard .net delegate/event paradigm instead of the clunky 
        "WaitForNextEvent" method.
        
    WebClient.ps1
        An example script demonstrating multiple background downloads
        using System.Net.WebClient incorporating Write-Progress progress
        reporting, and Ctrl+C handling with clean-up.
