I've been working on a Exchange management console a few weeks ago, which I saw burn down in flames once I couldn't get treeview and propertygrid events working. I was ready to switch over to C# untill I found pseventing. <br /><br />Anyways. I registerered the dll, but the snapin is not found in the registered list.... Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Mark<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Beginning the Install phase of the installation.<br />See the contents of the log file for the C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.dll assembly's progress.<br />The file is located at C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.InstallLog.<br />Installing assembly 'C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.dll'.<br />Affected parameters are:<br />   logtoconsole =<br />   assemblypath = C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.dll<br />   logfile = C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.InstallLog<br /><br />The Install phase completed successfully, and the Commit phase is beginning.<br />See the contents of the log file for the C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.dll assembly's progress.<br />The file is located at C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.InstallLog.<br />Committing assembly 'C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.dll'.<br />Affected parameters are:<br />   logtoconsole =<br />   assemblypath = C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.dll<br />   logfile = C:\\Temp\\Gui\\Nivot.PowerShell.Eventing.InstallLog<br /><br />The Commit phase completed successfully.<br /><br />The transacted install has completed.<br />PS C:\\Temp\\Gui&gt; Get-PSSnapin -Registered<br /><br /><br />Name        : Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.Admin<br />PSVersion   : 1.0<br />Description : Admin Tasks for the Exchange Server<br /><br /><br />",

I had the same issue a while back. <br />I testdrived pseventing in the 32bit console and indeed did not find an easy way to use it in conjunction with Winforms. Luckely I was able to get the required functionality with the events exposed by powershell, namely the afterselect and click.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Mark<br />",
