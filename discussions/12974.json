Could you send a link?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Bob<br />",

As regards WMI,  Mow (aka the \"powershellguy\") wrote a piece on using PSEventing with WMI not so long ago -- check it out here: <a href=\"http://thepowershellguy.com/blogs/posh/archive/2007/05/09/powershell-eventing-library-pseventing-0-5-beta-released.aspx\" class=\"externalLink\">http://thepowershellguy.com/blogs/posh/archive/2007/05/09/powershell-eventing-library-pseventing-0-5-beta-released.aspx<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a><br /><br />This was written for 0.5, but the only differences are that the PSEVent object's Source property was a path to the variable, whereas in 1.0 it <i>is</i> the variable.<br /><br />- Oisin<br />",
